# I'm working on figuring out how to incorporate tests. So far it's been tested only informally.
# One difficulty is that testing requires several large objects (up to 14 GB each) as inputs
# and I don't know where I can store these. My solution is probably going to be to test it on
# a reduced-dimension set of inputs (4k instead of 32k)

@testset "WatershedParcellation.jl" begin
    # Write your tests here.
end
